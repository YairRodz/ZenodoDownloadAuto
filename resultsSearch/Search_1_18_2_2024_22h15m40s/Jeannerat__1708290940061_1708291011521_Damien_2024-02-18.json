This success rate of 70.1% was significantly different from the mean pregnancy rate of 45.7% observed 17 days after fertilization using the same experimental protocol but without embryo flushing. Embryo recovery rate was not significantly dependent on whether the mares had been socially exposed to an MHC-dissimilar or an MHC-similar stallion. These observations suggest that MHC-linked maternal strategies affect embryo survival mainly (or only) during the time of fixation in the uterus.</p>","access_right":"open","license":{"id":"cc-zero"},"doi":"10.5061/dryad.s4mw6m936","keywords":["horses","Equus caballus","Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)","MHC similarity","social signaling","Embryo","Oviduct"],"notes":"<p>See description in Jeannerat et al.</p>\n<p>Funding provided by: ISMEquine Research<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: <br>Award Number: </p><p>Funding provided by: Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung<br>Crossref Funder Registry ID: http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711<br>Award Number: 31003A_182265</p>","communities":[{"id":"dryad"}]},{"publication_date":"2017-12-22","title":"Data from: Stallion semen quality depends on MHC matching to teaser mare","creators":[{"name":"Jeannerat, Elise","affiliation":"University of Bern"},{"name":"Marti, Eliane","affiliation":"University of Bern"},{"name":"Berney, Catherine","affiliation":"University of Lausanne"},{"name":"Janett, Fredi","affiliation":"University of Zurich"},{"name":"Bollwein, Heinrich","affiliation":"University of Zurich"},{"name":"Sieme, Harald","affiliation":"University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover"},{"name":"Burger, Dominik","affiliation":"University of Bern"},{"name":"Wedekind, Claus","affiliation":"University of Lausanne"}],"description":"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has repeatedly been found to influence mate choice of vertebrates, with MHC-dissimilar mates typically being preferred over MHC-similar mates.
